    bonus mult takes the nth nth simplical polytopic number.
    In simple terms:
    0 would be the first row (Basically an array of 1's, but we take 0 (special case))
    1 would be the second row (triangular numbers: 1, 3, 6, 10 ,15, 21 - we take 3 (second num))
    2 would be the third row (tetrahedral numbers: 1, 4, 10, 20, 35 - we take 10 (3rd num))
    3 would be the fourth row (pentachoron numbers: 1, 5, 15, 35, 70 - we take 35 (4th num))
    So on and so forth. List of them can be found https://oeis.org/wiki/Simplicial_polytopic_numbers
