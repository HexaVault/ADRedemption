    <li>Changed V's tab visibility post Mend, because they're usually unlocked before Nameless completion.</li>

    `In the words of YouTube commenters, "first". Yes, you're looking at the first mod with a new prestige layer, and second with new content. 
    Unfortunately since school is starting back up, further updates will be slow to roll out (unless it's a major game-breaking bug).
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>New things:</b>
    <br>
    <ul>
    <li>Added the Mending Prestige Layer.</li>
    <li>Added Mending Upgrades and Milestones.</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Notes:</b>
    <br>
    <ul>
    <li>Speedrun is available from begining of the game (but no splits for Mending content).</li>
    <li>Nothing pre-Mend is changed, so you can grab a save from Buck's savebank: https://buck4437.github.io/save-bank/.</li>
    <li>Endgame: 7 Mends and both Mending Upgrades.</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Known Issues:</b>
    <br>
    <ul>
    <li>Importing a save disables speedruns, be wary until I find a workaround.</li>

    this doesn't seem to affect gameplay in any way.</li>
